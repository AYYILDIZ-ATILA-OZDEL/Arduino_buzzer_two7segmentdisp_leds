# Arduino_buzzer_two7segmentdisp_leds
A system has been developed that gives a warning to the user with sound and RGB light at different frequencies from the buzzer when it is 0 or 99 by counting forward or down according to the starting number and password that the user will enter from the serial monitor, and stops these warnings when the password is entered at the beginning.
